        <h1>Cooking</h1>
        I live with my Fiance and our 4 dogs. After we finish with work and school it gets pretty late.
        Although just going out to eat would be more convient, its also a lot more expensive than Cooking
        at home. We both take turns cooking dinner and even cook together some days as a date night activity.
        These are just a few images of the stuff we have cooked.
