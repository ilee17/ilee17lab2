        <!-- Brief summary of my academics -->
        I am currently on my 5th year here at the University of Washington. Tranistioning into
        the UW from high school, I planned on majoring in Computer Science but I was not able to
        get in. I then tried to get into Informatics during my first 3 years here but was also
        unsuccessful. Now I am happy to say I am majoring in Geography Data Science.

        <img src="img/SCL.png" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">
        In additional to going to school full time, I am also currently working as a GIS
        analyst for Seattle City Light. I ended up working on the same department as my dad
        but he is an engineer. My dad and the fellow engineers will go out to the field and then
        create drawings for my team and I to draw into a map that is being utilitze by everyone.
        With it being the school year, I am only allowed to work up to 20 hours as this internship
        values our school and studies before everything else. I will usually find time between
        classes or after class to get my work done.
